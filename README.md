In the first semester we at FHICT teach the fundamental  concepts of programming to
our students. Currently we are collecting the material we created and putting it together.
The idea is teaching the basic concepts and teaching how to solve real life problems with the help of the internet!

The material is currently in courses PAC (pac_student_material.spiral.pdf)
and OIS12 (pac_student_material.spiral.pdf).
